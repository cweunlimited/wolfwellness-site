    <h2>Why Your Training Regimen Matters More With Time</h2>
    <p>As we age, the body naturally undergoes shifts in recovery speed, muscle mass, and hormone production. These changes can quietly influence energy, composition, and resilience. The answer isn’t to train less — it’s to train <em>smarter</em>. With a structured, progressive plan, you can preserve lean tissue, support hormonal balance, and maintain a body that performs — not just persists — through the years.</p>

    <h2>The Science of Strength and Hormones</h2>
    <p>Testosterone, growth hormone, and IGF-1 play central roles in vitality, muscle density, and fat metabolism. While these markers trend downward with age, resistance training — especially <strong>compound strength work</strong> — drives healthy, natural pulses of these hormones. It’s your way of signaling the body to stay strong and adaptive.</p>

    <h2>Why Compound Movements Are the Cornerstone</h2>
    <p>Compound lifts — squats, deadlifts, presses, rows, and pull-ups — recruit multiple joints and large muscle groups. This full-system demand not only builds functional strength but maximizes your metabolic and hormonal response. Each high-quality set tells your physiology to adapt, grow, and protect lean tissue — the foundation of long-term health.</p>

    <div class="pull-quote">“As you age, smart volume and great technique beat marathon workouts every time.”</div>

    <h2>Full-Body Training: The Hormonal Advantage</h2>
    <p>Recovery becomes more precious with time. Two to three <strong>full-body sessions</strong> per week provide the ideal blend of frequency and recovery. Instead of isolating muscles, these sessions emphasize coordination, posture, and controlled intensity — elevating heart rate, stimulating muscle fibers across the kinetic chain, and keeping your metabolism humming long after you’ve left the gym.</p>

    <h2>Body Composition and Longevity</h2>
    <p>Lean muscle is a metabolic engine. It aids blood-sugar control, supports joint integrity, and increases daily energy expenditure. The hormonal support from compound and full-body training promotes favorable body composition while reinforcing mental clarity and confidence. This is the kind of vitality that lets you move powerfully and age boldly.</p>

    <h2>Practical Framework: The W.O.L.F. Strength Standard</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Twice Weekly Strength:</strong> 4–6 compound movements per session (e.g., squat pattern, hinge, push, pull), 2–4 work sets each.</li>
      <li><strong>Skillful Progression:</strong> Add load or reps slowly; quality of movement stays non-negotiable.</li>
      <li><strong>Micro-Mobility:</strong> 5 minutes daily for hips, T-spine, and shoulders to protect positions.</li>
      <li><strong>Recovery Anchors:</strong> Hydration, protein with each meal, evening wind-down routine for sleep.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Train Smarter, Age Stronger</h2>
    <p>Aging isn’t a limitation — it’s leverage. With the right stimulus and recovery, your physiology responds. Compound movements, full-body organization, and mindful recovery create a synergy that keeps your hormones more stable, your body composition favorable, and your performance durable.</p>
